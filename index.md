## Introduction

Hi! My name is Ivan and I'm a Videogame developer currently studying Language technology in the University of Helsinki. I have experience teaching kids and adults how to code. As programmer I use, mainly, C# and Python. As C# programmer I'm focused mainly in game developing with Unity, although I've also used Unreal Engine. As Python programmer I'm focused in data science and natural language processing using libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, pytorch, matplotlib, Pandas, numpy and tkinter for basic interfaces. I speak fluent english and also speak some finnish, russian and german.

## Projects

### [TFG-IvanMontejoDeGarcini](https://github.com/IvanInRainbows/TFG-IvanMontejoDeGarcini)

This is the repository used to store all the code used in the process of making my Bachelor's thesis (Trabajo de fin de grado) for the applied linguistics degree in the Complutense University of Madrid. The aim of the thesis is to help discerning texts that have been generated by language models from those which have been written by humans. This project focuses specifically on detecting reviews in Spanish generated by the language model gpt-4. A more specific objective of the thesis is to determine relevant linguistic features that characterise AI-generated and human-generated texts and to create a prototype that can be used for this purpose using Python and machine-learning libraries.

The subject of this thesis is motivated by the fact that AI-generated text and language have been a growing concern during the last years. This has been especially true in academic environments, where there has been several cases of assignments entirely created by AI. These are difficult to detect due to the lack accurate tools.

### [TrabajoFinalHipermedia.github.io](https://github.com/IvanInRainbows/TrabajoFinalHipermedia.github.io)

The repository for the final project of the Hypermedia technologies (Tecnolog√≠as hipermedia) course taken in the Complutense University of madrid made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The page is also [published](https://github.com/IvanInRainbows/TrabajoFinalHipermedia.github.io) in Github pages. It's not working properly tho, it should have some fancy dynamic vector background.

### [cmdline-course](https://github.com/IvanInRainbows/cmdline-course)

Sample repository made for the [Command-Line Tools for Linguists](https://studies.helsinki.fi/kurssit/toteutus/hy-opt-cur-2526-261401a1-c550-4436-91b9-7edf4a1a3b57/KIK-LG221) course. Shows how git repositories work, how files change and how the repository is branched.

### [WordAnalyzerApp](https://github.com/IvanInRainbows/WordAnalyzerApp)

A desktop application built in python tkinter using wordnet libraries to analyze words in different levels and languages.
