## Introduction

Hi! My name is Ivan and I'm a Videogame developer currently studying Language technology in the University of Helsinki. I have experience teaching kids and adults how to code. As programmer I use, mainly, C# and Python. As C# programmer I'm focused mainly in game developing with Unity, although I've also used Unreal Engine. As Python programmer I'm focused in data science and natural language processing using libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, pytorch, matplotlib, Pandas, numpy and tkinter for basic interfaces. I speak fluent english and also speak some finnish, russian and german.
